Pair 1,Affecto,"I understand how unsettling this must be for you, Alex. A positive FOBT result means that some blood was found in your stool, but this doesn’t automatically mean something serious. It could be caused by several things, many of which are treatable. The next step, a colonoscopy, will help us figure it out. You’re taking an important step toward understanding what’s happening, and that’s a good thing.",surprise,0.6862
