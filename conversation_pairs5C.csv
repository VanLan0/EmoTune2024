I just got a positive result from my FOBT test. What does that mean?,"A positive FOBT result indicates that blood was found in your stool sample. This can be due to a variety of reasons, including polyps, haemorrhoids, or other gastrointestinal issues. However, it could also be an early sign of colorectal cancer. Further tests, such as a colonoscopy, are needed to determine the cause of the bleeding."
Does this mean I have cancer?,"A positive FOBT result does not necessarily mean you have cancer. It indicates that blood was detected in your stool, which could be from various benign or malignant sources. A colonoscopy is the next step to identify the cause of the bleeding and confirm if cancer is present."
Do I really need to go through with the colonoscopy? I’m scared,A colonoscopy is the most effective method for detecting the source of bleeding in the colon. It allows doctors to examine the entire colon and remove any suspicious polyps or tissue for further analysis. Skipping this test could delay the diagnosis of potentially serious conditions.
I’ve heard colonoscopies are painful. Is that true?,"Most people do not experience pain during a colonoscopy. The procedure is usually performed under sedation, so you may feel minimal discomfort. Some may experience mild bloating or cramping afterward, but the benefits of early detection of conditions like polyps or cancer typically outweigh these temporary effects."
I’m not ready for this. Is there another test I can take?,"While there are other diagnostic tests, such as a CT colonography or a flexible sigmoidoscopy, they are not as comprehensive as a colonoscopy. These alternatives may not detect small polyps or abnormalities in the entire colon, making a colonoscopy the gold standard for thorough investigation."
How long do I have to wait before I know if I have cancer?,"After your colonoscopy, any polyps or tissue samples taken will be sent for biopsy, and results typically take a few days to a week. The timing depends on the clinic's processing time and lab availability. Your doctor will notify you as soon as results are available."
Can I do anything to avoid a colonoscopy? I’m really anxious about it.,"Currently, a colonoscopy is the most reliable method for diagnosing the cause of a positive FOBT result. It’s understandable to feel anxious, but avoiding the procedure could result in missing important early warning signs of serious conditions such as colorectal cancer."
I feel like I’m getting more and more anxious the more I learn. What can I do?,"Anxiety surrounding medical procedures is common. You may benefit from speaking with a healthcare provider about your concerns. They can offer support, including medication to reduce anxiety or more information about what to expect during the procedure to ease your worries."
What are the chances I’ll actually have cancer?,"Statistics vary based on age, family history, and other risk factors. In many cases, a positive FOBT result is caused by benign conditions such as polyps or haemorrhoids. However, a colonoscopy is necessary to rule out colorectal cancer or confirm any diagnosis"
I’m still not ready for this. What happens if I delay the colonoscopy?,"Delaying a colonoscopy could postpone the diagnosis of potential issues, including early-stage colorectal cancer, which is treatable if caught early. The longer you wait, the higher the risk that an undiagnosed condition could progress, making treatment more complex in the future."
