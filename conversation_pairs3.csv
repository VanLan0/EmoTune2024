Alex: I just got a positive cancer result  on my iFOBT screening. I'm worried. What does that mean?,"CognitoAI: A positive iFOBT result indicates that there was blood in your stool, which can be a sign of colorectal cancer or other conditions. It's important to follow up with a colonoscopy to get a clearer understanding of the cause."
Alex: How accurate is this test? Could it be a mistake?,"CognitoAI: The iFOBT is generally accurate and is specifically designed to detect human hemoglobin. However, no test is perfect. The specificity of the iFOBT is quite high, but false positives can occur due to factors like certain medications or diets."
Alex: What happens during a colonoscopy?,"CognitoAI: During a colonoscopy, a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end is inserted into the rectum to view the entire colon and rectum. This allows the doctor to see and remove polyps or other abnormal tissue."
Alex: Is the procedure painful?,"CognitoAI: Most patients receive sedatives and pain relief to minimize discomfort during the procedure. You might feel pressure or brief cramps, but severe pain is uncommon."
Alex: What are the risks of a colonoscopy?,"CognitoAI: The risks are low but include possible complications like perforation of the colon, bleeding from the site where a polyp was removed, and reactions to the sedatives used."
Alex: How long does it take to recover from a colonoscopy?,CognitoAI: Recovery from the sedation used during a colonoscopy typically takes about 24 hours. Most people are able to return to normal activities the next day.
Alex: What if they find something during the procedure?,"CognitoAI: If any polyps are found, they are usually removed during the procedure for biopsy. Depending on the biopsy results, further treatment or regular monitoring might be recommended."
Alex: How often should I get screened?,"CognitoAI: Screening frequency depends on your individual risk factors, including age, family history, and the results of this initial test. Your doctor will provide a personalized recommendation."
Alex: Can diet or medication affect the results?,"CognitoAI: Yes, certain foods and medications can affect the results of an iFOBT. For example, red meat, certain vegetables, and some medications can lead to false positives."
Alex: What should I do next?,CognitoAI: It is important to schedule a colonoscopy as soon as possible. This is the best next step to determine the cause of the blood detected in your stool and to take appropriate action.
