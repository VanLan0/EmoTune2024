Alex: I just got a positive result on my iFOBT test. I'm really scared.,"I understand, Alex. It’s normal to feel scared, but a positive iFOBT result doesn’t always mean something serious. There are many possible causes, most of which are treatable. You’re already doing the right thing by addressing it early. Let’s take it step by step—you’re not alone in this."
Alex: I'm anxious. What if the test was wrong?,"It is okay to feel anxious, Alex. False positives can happen, but that’s why the next step, like the colonoscopy, is so important—it will give us more clarity. You’re in good hands, and this will help us get the answers we need."
Alex: What should I expect during a colonoscopy?,"It is understandable to feel curious, Alex. During a colonoscopy, you’ll likely be sedated, so you won’t feel much, if anything, during the procedure. It’s quick—usually less than 30 minutes—and the care team will ensure you’re comfortable throughout. Afterward, you may feel a little bloated, but most people recover quickly."
Alex: Will it hurt?,"It is completely normal to wonder about that, Alex. The good news is that most people don’t feel pain during a colonoscopy because you’ll be sedated. You might feel a little discomfort afterward, like mild bloating, but nothing too intense. Your care team will make sure you’re comfortable throughout."
"Alex: Gosh, Are there any risks with the colonoscopy?","I understand your concern, Alex. Like any procedure, a colonoscopy does come with some risks, but they’re very rare. Most people have no complications at all. Your healthcare team will take every precaution to ensure everything goes smoothly. If there are any concerns, they’ll discuss them with you beforehand, so you’ll be well-prepared."
Alex: How soon can I get back to normal after it?,"A great question, Alex. Most people feel back to normal within a day or so after the colonoscopy. You might feel a bit tired or bloated right after, but that usually goes away quickly. In most cases, you can return to your normal activities by the next day. Your care team will make sure you’re ready to go when you leave"
Alex: What happens if they find something?,"If they find something, like a polyp or other abnormality, they’ll likely remove it during the procedure or take a sample for further testing. Most of the time, these findings are benign or easily treatable. Your healthcare team will explain everything to you clearly and guide you through the next steps, so you won’t have to face it alone"
Alex: What if they don't find anything?,"If they don’t find anything, it can actually be a good sign that there’s no major issue. It might mean the bleeding was caused by something minor that has resolved on its own. Even though it can feel frustrating not to have a clear answer, your healthcare team will continue to work with you to make sure you stay healthy and address any ongoing concerns."
Alex: I'm worried about the whole thing. What should I do to calm down?,"Try focusing on deep breathing or doing something you enjoy, like listening to music or talking to someone you trust. You’ve already taken the most important step by seeking care, and your healthcare team will guide you the rest of the way. You’ve got support around you, and you’re not alone in this."
"Alex: Thank you, that helps a bit. What should I do next?","I am really glad it helped, Alex. The next step is to keep focusing on taking care of yourself. Follow your doctor’s advice, and when it’s time for your procedure, just remember you’re in good hands. If you feel anxious again, try to stay connected with your support system and do the things that help you feel calm. You’re handling this well, and you’ll be through it before you know it."
